The **Institute for Research on Innovation and Science** (IRIS) is a member consortium
of universities anchored by an IRB-approved data repository hosted at the University of
Michigan’s Institute for Social Research. IRIS was founded in 2015 with support from the
Alfred P. Sloan and Ewing Marion Kauffman foundations.

IRIS collects record-level administrative data from its members to produce a
de-identified dataset for research and reporting that will improve our ability to
understand, explain, and improve the public value of research. Its mission is to be a
trusted resource for high-quality data that supports independent, frontier research on
science and innovation in the service of the public interest.
